brief_description: The variety of data systems and applications implies a plethora of data formats, standards and protocols that require common management. Interoperability at data and protocol level becomes essential for knowledge extraction, knowledge generation, usage of semantics and polyglot usability. We research and develop middleware systems that are part of wider frameworks for data sovereignty and control as the Data Spaces.
summary: 
    The variety of data systems, formats, representation standards, but also the diverse usage of protocols, limit data exchange and the extraction of knowledge that can be swiftly applied by applications with polyglot needs. Through several applicational projects, supported by real-use cases, we research, develop and deploy methodologies, middleware systems for interoperability, namely through the use of semantic interoperability. Moreover, we also research and develop systems aligned with the Data Spaces for improved data sovereignty guarantees for privacy and control on top of data.
goals:
  - name: DataSpaces
    description: DataSpaces envisions data usage to be controlled regarding who, when and for which purpose data can be used, i.e, ensuring data sovereignty, thus supporting a robust and collaborative ecosystem guided by law, regulations, and data usage directives. It it build on four key features that are embodied in the technologies that support data space deployments, namely a) security and privacy, b) quality and integrity, c) policy and governance, and d) Performance and high availability.
      You can check more details on our roadmap in our <a href="https://www.inesctec.pt/uploads/inline/DataSpaces_Manifesto.pdf"> Data Spaces Manifesto</a>.
  - name: Applications
    description: Many challenging applications now rely on data intensive computing, such as decentralized  privacy-preserving proximi tracking during the COVID-19 epidemic.
