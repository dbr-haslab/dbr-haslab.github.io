brief_description: The variety of data systems and applications implies a plethora of data formats, standards and protocols that require common management. Interoperability at data and protocol level becomes essential for knowledge extraction, knowledge generation, usage of semantics and poliglot usability. We research and develop middleware systems that are part of wider frameworks for data sovereignthy and control as the Data Spaces.
summary: 
    The variety of data systems, formats, representation standards, but also the diverse usage of protocols, limit data exchange and the extraction of knowledge that can be swiftly applied by applications with poliglot needs. Through several applicational projects, supported by real-use cases, we research, develop and deploy methodologies, middleware systems for interoperability, namely through the use of semantic interoperability. Moreover, we aslo research and develop systems aligned with the Data Spaces for improved data sovereignhty guarantees for privacy and control on top of data.
