brief_description:  Data and data management is ubiquitous in today's societey and economy. The efficiency, scalability and privacy in the scope of data management is paramount. DBR research and designs new techniques and middleware systems for the next generation of distributed data management, from the edge and to the cloud, covering the full comuting continuum.
summary: 
  <p> Data is the foundation of modern innovation, decision-making, and operational efficiency. Central to managing this data are databasesâ€”organized systems that securely store vast amounts of information. 
  </p>

  <p>

  Transactional systems leverage these databases to perform essential business processes with precision and consistency, often across distributed environments, including cloud and edge computing systems, where data is stored and processed closer to the source. Ensuring the dependability and integrity of these systems is vital for building trust, maintaining operational continuity. 
  </p>

  <p> We research and build efficient and dependable middleware systems for cloud, distributed and edge database systems. We specificlly focus in transactional guarantees and geo-replication , polyglot access and querying to multiple data souces and privacy and data security.

    description: DSR is investing in researching in inclusion of database management primitives in edge devices. This includes leveraging from existing accelerator units in the edge hardware, and the usage innovative memory options to support maintenance of edge database nodes or small data models. We span from devices with microcontoller, microprocessor or sink nodes. Future work moves into inlcusion of data placement, distributed coordination among edge nodes.
