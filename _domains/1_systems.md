summary: 
  <p> Data is the foundation of modern innovation, decision-making, and operational efficiency. Central to managing this data are databasesâ€”organized systems that securely store vast amounts of information. 
  </p>

  <p>

  Transactional systems leverage these databases to perform essential business processes with precision and consistency, often across distributed environments, including cloud and edge computing systems, where data is stored and processed closer to the source. Ensuring the dependability and integrity of these systems is vital for building trust, maintaining operational continuity. 
  </p>

  <p> We research and build efficient and dependable middleware systems for cloud, distributed and edge database systems. We specificlly focus in transactional guarantees and geo-replication , polyglot access and querying to multiple data souces and privacy and data security.
