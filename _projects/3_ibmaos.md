description: Middleware system that is able to efficiently handle data from document-based repositories.
---

 This project builds a joint attempt with IBM Research Zurich to design a middleware system that is able to efficiently handle data from document-based repositories. The system is built from a caching mechanism that leverages a in-house designed columnar format, specifically designed for data analytics. Moreover, it integrates RDMA network interconnects to handle seamless distributed execution over the document repository.
