Smarty Flow aims to create a platform for the use of virtual identity documents to expedite the process of identifying citizens at airports, ports and in the use of additional services that imply the identification of the consumer, such as hotels, car rental, travel agencies, entertainment, among others. The user may use their biometrics (face, fingerprint or iris) as proof of identity to be authenticated, via agile self-service processes that do not require the citizen to produce any physical documents.

The new identification experience is based on the use of mobile phones, such as cell phones, tablets, and others, containing the digital identity document securely virtualized and ready for any interactions.

The project has a strategic relevance for the national economy, further reinforcing the image of the country as a recognized innovation stage. Additionally, the implementation of the project is very relevant to secure our borders while it is also expected that it has a positive effect on tourism, a strategic sector of the country.
