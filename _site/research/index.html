  <h1 id="research">Research</h1>

<p>Our research is currently divided in three main topics:</p>

<h3 id="large-scale-data-processing">Large Scale Data Processing</h3>

<p>The work on large scale data processing e focused in develop new solutions to fit current demands in cloud based database solutions. These leverage the scalability and elastic capabilities of this programming model to serve both larger user domains and disruptive data volumes. The developed systems span from middleware solutions either to complement or to fully provide processing semantics over already existing systems or full query engines that incomporate the developed techniques.</p>

<h4 id="projects">Projects</h4>

<p><a href="http://clouddb.eu">CloudDBAppliance</a> This project aims at producing a European Cloud Database Appliance for providing a Database as a Service able to match the predictable performance, robustness and trustworthiness of on premise architectures such as those based on mainframes. We are particularly involved in tasks related to the load balancing and faul-tolerance of database requests and the orchestration/deployment of database components.</p>

<p><a href="">Accelerated Object Stores</a> This project builds a joint atempt with <a href="https://www.zurich.ibm.com/">IBM Research Zurich</a> to design a middleware system that is able to efficiently handle data from document-based repositories. The system is built from a caching mechanism that leverages a in-house designed columnar format, specifically deisigned for data analytics. Moreover, it integrates RDMA network interconnects to handle seamless distributed execution over the document repository.</p>

<h3 id="secure-data-processing">Secure Data Processing</h3>

<p>The work on secure data processing aims at building practical database systems that follow a privacy-by-design methodology. Current work explores the security, funcionality and performance tradeoffs provided by current cryptographic primitives (e.g., standard, deterministic, order-preserving, searchable encryption) and secure hardware platforms (e.g., Intel SGX) when integrated with state-of-the-art NoSQL, SQL and Analytical database engines.</p>

<h4 id="projects-1">Projects</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.safecloud-project.eu">SafeCloud</a> The SafeCloud H2020 project aims at re-architecting cloud infrastructures to ensure that data transmission, storage, and processing are done in a reliable and private fashion. Our work in the project is focused on providing different database solutions that provide private data storage and processing while being practical and usable in real-world deployments. Namely we highlight the following sub-projects/solutions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="">SafeNoSQL</a> This solution comprehends a generic NoSQL framework, together with a set of libraries supporting data processing cryptographic techniques (e.g., standard, deterministic, order-preserving primitives) that can be used with existing NoSQL engines and composed to meet the privacy and performance requirements of different applications. This is achieved through a modular and extensible design that enables secure data processing by leveraging multiple cryptographic techniques applied on the same database. Current research is applying this framework to a wider range of NoSQL databases and supporting novel secure processing technologies such as Intel SGX.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="">D’artagnan</a> This solution leverages secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols for current NoSQL databases. In detail, D’artagnan is the first NoSQL solution that resorts to MPC for providing a secure database solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="">Secure Queries Solutions</a> These solutions provide a scalable database design, exporting an ansi-SQL interface, 
that can be combined with either SafeNoSQL or D’artagnan to provide a secure SQL database. This work also contemplates novel database systems for analytical and web-based query processing that leverage multiple cryptographic primitives and the Intel SGX platform to enable privacy-aware processing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h3>

<h4 id="projects-2">Projects</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/faclc4/HTAPBench">HTAPBench</a> HTAPBench is a benchmarking suite designed for database engines that support hybrid workloads (HTAP) composed of high levels of transactional activity and, at the same time, provide business analytics directly over production data. It provides a unified metric for HTAP systems geared toward the execution of constantly increasing OLAP requests limited by an admissible impact on OLTP performance.</p>

<!-- [SafeFS](https://github.com/safecloud-project/safefs) is a software-defined file system based on a modular architecture featuring stackable layers that can be combined to construct a secure distributed file system. SafeFS allows users to specialize their data store to their specific needs by choosing the combination of layers that provide the best safety and performance tradeoffs. The prototype is implemented in user space using FUSE. The provided layers include mechanisms based on encryption, replication, and coding. -->
