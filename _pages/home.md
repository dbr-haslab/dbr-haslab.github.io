Database research at [HASLab](http://www.haslab.uminho.pt) is motivated by the key role played by database systems in modern society, triggering a lot of interest from research to industry such as cloud computing, internet-of-things, storage formats for data processing or machine learning/artificial inteligence. All of these topics, but particularly the first one is what drives us to develop efficient, scalable, resilient and secure solutions that are able to adapt to sheer volume of data handled today and the expected increase in years to come.

To this end, our research is focused on three main areas: **Large Scale Data Processing**, **Secure Data Processing** and **Benchmarking**. These three areas comprehend a set of specific sub-topics such as: Distributed Databases, Distributed Transaction Processing, Scalable SQL Analytics, Secure NoSQL/SQL or Secure Analytics. By covering a large spectrum of nowadays Database research, we intend to contribute to the next generation of distributed, scalable and fault-tolerant database systems that are able to seamlessly adapt to heterogeneous hardware configurations powered by current cloud computing infraestructures (see [Research](research)). 

Our team is composed of researchers from the [High-Assurance Software Laboratory (HASLab)](http://www.haslab.uminho.pt), mainly from the Distributed Systems field. HASLab is one of the integrated R&D centres of [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt), a leading national associate laboratory, and a teaching and research subunit of the [University of Minho](http://www.uminho.pt), where it is headquartered.

Research at HASLab is anchored on a rigorous approach to three areas of Computer Science: Software Engineering, Distributed Systems and Cryptography and Information Security. The laboratory's contributions to these areas range from fundamental research on formal methods and algorithms to applied research on tools and middleware that address real-world demands stemming from long-term collaborations with industry.
