description: A generic NoSQL framework, together with a set of libraries supporting data processing cryptographic techniques.
---

This solution comprehends a generic NoSQL framework, together with a set of libraries supporting data processing cryptographic techniques (e.g., standard, deterministic, order-preserving primitives) that can be used with existing NoSQL engines and composed to meet the privacy and performance requirements of different applications. This is achieved through a modular and extensible design that enables secure data processing by leveraging multiple cryptographic techniques applied on the same database.
